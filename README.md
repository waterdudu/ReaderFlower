### Purpose 
I planned to write a google reader client on iOS, but this project is stopped when google announced Google Reader is going to shut down at July 1.
I hope it's still usefull for you to learn how to use popular 3rd libraris like fmdb, DTCoreText, ASIHTTPRequest etc.

Currently, it is only support landscape mode on ipad.
